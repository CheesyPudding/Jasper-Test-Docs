## What is Trello?
Trello is a web-based team-organizing and collaboration software, which is available at [trello.com](https://trello.com/). It is similar to writing down project tasks on sticky notes and organizing them on a whiteboard. Trello allows more flexibility and functionality in editing and customizing these tasks.

## Why use Trello?
We know that team projects could easily get disorganized as more features are added to the project. Trello helps project groups visualize  tasks to be worked on and provides the functionality to group together different tasks. Team members could be added to specific team tasks and be informed of ongoing task changes. Trello also allows your  project team members to be informed of who is working on what task and keeps your team informed of deadlines. Trello is easy to learn and provides a system to organize your team projects, so your team can be informed and get things done.
