**3.** Give your team a name and the team type. You could also give your team a description, but it is not mandatory.

**4.** You now have the option to invite your team members to the board now, or you can do it in a later step (See [Invite members to board](https://cheesypudding.github.io/Jasper-Test-Docs/docs/customization/)).
