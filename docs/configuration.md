# Create a board
{: .no_toc }


A Trello board allows you to organize tasks for your team. Let’s start by creating a team and a board.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

1. First, make sure you are on the home page by clicking on the home button.

    ![home button](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/create-a-board-step-1-image-1.png?raw=true "home button"){: .center}

2. Then, create a team by clicking on the plus button on the left side of the page.

</p>
<br />

3. Give your team a name and the team type. You could also give your team a description, but it is not mandatory.

</p>
<br />

4. You now have the option to invite your team members to the board now, or you can do it in a later step (See [Invite members to board](https://cheesypudding.github.io/Jasper-Test-Docs/docs/customization/)).

</p>
<br />

5. Once you have created a team, click on the “+” icon on the top right hand corner of the Trello header. On the pop-up, click on “Create board”.

</p>
<br />

6. Give your board a name. Selecting “Team visible" ensures your team members can collaborate on it.
