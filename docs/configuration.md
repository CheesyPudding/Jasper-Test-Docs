{: .no_toc }


A Trello board allows you to organize tasks for your team. Let’s start by creating a team and a board.

1. First, make sure you are on the home page by clicking on the home button.

2. Then, create a team by clicking on the plus button on the left side of the page.

3. Give your team a name and the team type.

    ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/alert.png?raw=true "Note")**NOTE** You could give your team a description, but it is not mandatory. 

    ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/alert.png?raw=true "Note")**NOTE** You now have the option to invite your team members to the board now, or you can do it in a later step (See [Invite members to board](https://cheesypudding.github.io/Jasper-Test-Docs/docs/customization/)).

4. Click on the “+” icon on the top right hand corner of the Trello header, once you have created a team. Click on “Create board” on the pop-up.
