## Create lists and cards
To fill our board with contents, we will create a few lists and cards. Each card represents a single task and each list consists of a list of tasks.


**1.** Now let’s first add a list to the board. Example below shows three lists To do, Doing and Done. You can create more lists and you can give it any name you want. Simply by clicking on the + Add another list icon as shown below.

</p>

**2.** After creating a list you can create cards simply by clicking on the + Add a card icon, and name the card to a specific task you must complete.

</p>

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/alert.png?raw=true">**NOTE** To remove an unwanted or excessive list, click the three dots in the top-right corner of a list and click the last option “Archive this list” in the pop-up menu.

</p>

Archiving a list will remove it from the board, but they can still be recovered by accessing the “... more” button on the right-side menu and clicking the “Archived items” button on the more menu.

</p>

**3.** Once you have filled your list(s) with many cards, you can simply rearrange the order of them by holding on a card and dragging it up or down to the desired order.

## Customize Cards
We will now fill our empty cards by detailing them with some features in Trello. You can edit the name of the card by clicking on the text, add descriptions, write comments, add members, labels, checklist, due date, add attachment, and create covers for your card.

**1.** First, we will edit our cards with some task details. You can edit the card by right-clicking on it and selecting “Open Card”, or by clicking the card.

</p>

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/alert.png?raw=true">**NOTE** To remove an unwanted card, follow this step and click the "Archive” button at the very bottom of the pop-up editing menu when right-clicking a card. Archiving a card will remove it from the board, but they can still be recovered the same way as a list. (see the note on archiving a list for recovering a card)

**2.** This is the card editing menu where you can now freely edit the card. There are many options in this menu. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/customize-cards-step -2-&-step-4.png?raw=true">
</p>

First, let’s assign yourself to a task by clicking the first button “Members” on the “Add to card” list on the right side.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/customize-cards-step-2-2.PNG?raw=true">
</p>

Next, select the member(s) you would like to assign to the task. For example, adding yourself to the task should change the task on the board to appear with your initials in an icon.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/customize-cards-step-2-3.PNG?raw=true">
</p>

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/alert.png?raw=true">**NOTE** Cards can have multiple assigned members, but you will need to invite members to your board first. [see the instructions on inviting members to a board](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/docs/customization/)

**3.** Next, let’s add a short description that gives the task a little more info. First access the card editing menu again and click on the box in the middle of the menu underneath the “Description” tag. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/customize-cards-step-3.PNG?raw=true">
</p>

Then, add a meaningful description and click the “Save” icon. You can discard or edit the description by clicking on the box again.

**4.** Next, let’s also add coloured labels to a task to give it some more visibility. Access the card editing menu again and click the second button “Labels” on the “Add to card” list on the right side.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/customize-cards-step-2 -&-step-4.png?raw=true">
</p>

Here you can click on labels to add to your card. You can also customize the colour and text on labels or delete a label by clicking the pencil icon on the right side of the label you want to edit. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/customize-cards-step-4-2.PNG?raw=true">
</p>

**5.** We will also add a due date to our task. Access the card editing menu again and click the second button “Due date” on the “Add to card” list on the right side. 
Here you can select a due date and optionally the start date. You can also set a reminder before the due date for all your team members if you set one. You can edit the due date by clicking on the “Due date” button again.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/customize-cards-step-5.PNG?raw=true">
</p>

**6.** Finally, we can mark a task as complete once a task passes the due date. If you complete the task before the due date, simply set the due date to the date completed first. 
On the card editing menu, a pop-up will appear above the description that indicates the due date. Click the box to add a checkmark and your task should now be marked as completed.

</p>

**7.** In the end, your task card should appear like this on the trello board:

</p>

In addition,Trello provides users with other unique features shown below where users can explore and make use of all the features the Trello can provide to further customize tasks. Power-Ups are a notable feature which let users integrate other third party apps such as a calendar or Google-Drive to have all documents and info in Trello.
