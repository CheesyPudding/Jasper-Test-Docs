## Create lists and cards
After [creating a Trello board](https://cheesypudding.github.io/Jasper-Test-Docs/docs/configuration/), you can add lists and cards to it. Each card represents a single task and each list consists of a list of tasks.


You will first need to add a list to the board before adding cards to the list.

1. Navigate to your board's homepage.

    ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/imagescreate-a-board-step-1-image-1.png?raw=true "add another list")
<br />
<br />

2. Click on the "+ Add another list" icon.

   The example below shows three lists: To do, Doing, and Done. You can create more lists and give your list any name.

<br />
<br />

3. Click on the "+ Add a card" icon to create cards on the list, and give the card a name, which indicates a specific task for your project.

    <img align="left" src="https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/alert.png?raw=true">**NOTE** To remove a list, click the three dots in the top-right corner of the list. Then click the last option “Archive this list” in the pop-up menu.

    ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/create-lists-and-cards-step-2-NOTE.PNG?raw=true "remove list")
<br />

   Archiving a list will remove it from the board, but they can still be recovered by accessing the “... more” button on the right-side menu and clicking the “Archived items” button on the more menu.

<br />
<br />
   

3. Rearrange the order of your cards in a list by clicking and dragging on a card and dragging it up or down to the desired order.

## Customize cards
We will now fill our empty cards by detailing them with some features in Trello. You can edit the name of the card by clicking on the text, add descriptions, write comments, add members, labels, checklist, due date, add attachment, and create covers for your card.

1. First, we will edit our cards with some task details. You can edit the card by right-clicking on it and selecting “Open Card”, or by clicking the card.

      ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/customize-cards-step-1.png?raw=true "edit card")
<br />

   ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/custimize-cards-step-1-2.png?raw=true "edit card menu")
<br />

   <img align="left" src="https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/alert.png?raw=true">**NOTE** To remove an unwanted card, follow this step and click the "Archive” button at the very bottom of the pop-up editing menu when right-clicking a card. Archiving a card will remove it from the board, but they can still be recovered the same way as a list. (see the note on archiving a list for recovering a card)
<br />

   This is the card editing menu where you can now freely edit the card. There are many options in this menu. 

   ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/customize-cards-step-2 -&-step-4.png?raw=true "card editing menu")
<br />
<br />

2. Click the first button “Members” on the “Add to card” list on the right side to start assigning yourself to a task.

   ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/customize-cards-step-2-2.PNG?raw=true "assign member")
<br />
<br />

3. Next, select the member(s) you would like to assign to the task. For example, adding yourself to the task should change the task on the board to appear with your initials in an icon.

      ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/customize-cards-step-2-3.PNG?raw=true "assigned task")
<br />

   <img align="left" src="https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/alert.png?raw=true">**NOTE** Cards can have multiple assigned members, but you will need to invite members to your board first. [(see the instructions on inviting members to a board)](https://cheesypudding.github.io/Jasper-Test-Docs/docs/customization/)
<br />
<br />

4. Next, let’s add a short description that gives the task a little more info. First access the card editing menu again and click on the box in the middle of the menu underneath the “Description” tag. 

5. Then, add a meaningful description and click the “Save” icon. You can discard or edit the description by clicking on the box again.

      ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/customize-cards-step-3.PNG?raw=true "description")
<br />
<br />

6. Next, let’s also add coloured labels to a task to give it some more visibility. Access the card editing menu again and click the second button “Labels” on the “Add to card” list on the right side.

    ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/customize-cards-step-2 -&-step-4.png?raw=true "labels")
<br />

   Here you can click on labels to add to your card. You can also customize the colour and text on labels or delete a label by clicking the pencil icon on the right side of the label you want to edit.
   
   
   ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/customize-cards-step-4-2.PNG?raw=true "labels again")
<br />
<br />

7. We will also add a due date to our task. Access the card editing menu again and click the second button “Due date” on the “Add to card” list on the right side. 

      Here you can select a due date and optionally the start date. You can also set a reminder before the due date for all your team members if you set one. 

8. You can edit the due date by clicking on the “Due date” button again.

    ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/customize-cards-step-5.PNG?raw=true "due date")
<br />

   Finally, we can mark a task as complete once a task passes the due date. If you complete the task before the due date, simply set the due date to the date completed first. 

9. On the card editing menu, a pop-up will appear above the description that indicates the due date. Click the box to add a checkmark and your task should now be marked as completed.

    ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/customize-cards-step-6.PNG?raw=true "task complete")

In the end, your customized and detailed task card should appear like this on the trello board:

   ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/customize-cards-step-7.PNG?raw=true "final state")
<br />
<br />

In addition,Trello provides users with other unique features shown below where users can explore and make use of all the features the Trello can provide to further customize tasks. Power-Ups are a notable feature which let users integrate other third party apps such as a calendar or Google-Drive to have all documents and info in Trello.
