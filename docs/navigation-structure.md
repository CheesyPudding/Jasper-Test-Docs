## Create lists and cards
After [creating a Trello board](https://cheesypudding.github.io/Jasper-Test-Docs/docs/configuration/), you can add lists and cards to it. Each card represents a single task and each list consists of a list of tasks.

You will first need to add a list to the board before adding cards to the list.

1. Navigate to your board's homepage by clicking on the home button and then your board.

    ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/lists-and-cards-step-1-image-1.png?raw=true "navigate to board")
<br />
<br />

2. Click on the "+ Add another list" icon.

   The example below shows three lists with the names To do, Doing, and Done. You can create more lists and give them any name.

<br />
<br />

3. Click on the "+ Add a card" icon to create cards on the list, and give the card a name, which indicates a specific task for your project.

    <img align="left" src="https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/alert.png?raw=true">**NOTE** To remove a list, click the three dots in the top-right corner of the list. Then click the last option “Archive this list” in the pop-up menu.

    ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/lists-and-cards-step-3-image-1.png?raw=true "remove list")
<br />

   Archiving a list will remove it from the board, but they can still be recovered by accessing the “... more” button on the right-side menu and clicking the “Archived items” button on the more menu.
   
   ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/lists-and-cards-step-3-image-2.png?raw=true "recover archive")
<br />
<br />
   
   Rearrange the order of your cards in a list by clicking and dragging on a card and dragging it up or down to the desired order.

<br />

## Customize cards
Now that you have created your lists with cards, customize them by adding members, adding a description for the task, labelling the task, and adding a due date of the task.

1. Right-click your card and select "Open Card".

      ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/lists-and-cards-customize-step-1-image-1.png?raw=true "edit card")
<br />

   ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/lists-and-cards-customize-step-1-image-2.png?raw=true "edit card menu")
<br />

   <img align="left" src="https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/alert.png?raw=true">**NOTE** Remove unwanted cards by clicking on the "Archive” button at the bottom of the above pop-up editing menu. Archiving a card will remove it from the board, but they can still be recovered the same way as a list. (see the note above in Step 3 on archiving a list for recovering a card).
<br />

   You should now see the card editing menu where the card customization features are located.

   ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/lists-and-cards-customize-step-1-image-3.png?raw=true "card editing menu")
<br />
<br />

2. Click “Members” on the right side under “Add to card” to add team members to a task.

   ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/lists-and-cards-customize-step-2-image-1.png?raw=true "assign member")
<br />
<br />

3. Search and select the member(s) you would like to assign to the task. 

   Adding yourself to the task should change the task on the board to appear with your initials in an icon.

      ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/lists-and-cards-customize-step-3-image-1.png.PNG?raw=true "assigned task")
<br />

   <img align="left" src="https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/alert.png?raw=true">**NOTE** Cards can have multiple assigned members, but you will need to [invite members to your board](https://cheesypudding.github.io/Jasper-Test-Docs/docs/customization/) first. 
<br />
<br />

4. Navigate back to the card editing menu as described in Step 1 and add a short description of the task in the box under the "Description" heading. 

5. Click the “Save” button.

    You can discard or edit the description by clicking on the box again.

      ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/lists-and-cards-customize-step-5-image-1.png?raw=true "description")
<br />
<br />

6. Navigate back to the card editing menu as described in Step 1 and click on "Labels".

    ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/lists-and-cards-customize-step-6-image-1.png?raw=true "labels")
<br />

   Here, you can click on labels to add to your card. You can also customize the colour and text on labels or delete a label by clicking the pencil icon on the right side of the label you want to edit. Adding coloured labels to a task can give it more visibility on a full or busy board.
   
   
   ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/lists-and-cards-customize-step-6-image-2.png?raw=true "labels again")
<br />
<br />

7. Navigate back to the card editing menu as described in Step 1 and click on "Due date" to add a due date to your task.

      Here you can select a due date, and optionally, the start date. You can also set a reminder, before the due date, to your team members. You can edit the due date by clicking on the “Due date” button again.

   <img align="left" src="https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/alert.png?raw=true">**NOTE** After setting a due date, click "Save" to save the due date to the card.
<br />

   ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/lists-and-cards-customize-step-7-image-1.png?raw=true "due date")
<br />

   On the card editing menu, you should now see a "Due Date" pop-up above the task description.
   
   You can mark a task as complete by clicking on the due date checkbox. If you complete the task before the due date, you can set the due date to the date completed.

   ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/lists-and-cards-customize-step-7-image-2.png?raw=true "task complete")

Back on your Trello board, your customized and detailed task card should appear like:

   ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/customize-cards-step-7.PNG?raw=true "final state")
<br />
<br />

  In addition, Trello provides users with other unique features where users can explore and further customize tasks. For example, Power-Ups lets users integrate third party apps, such as a calendar or Google-Drive, to have all team documents and information connected to Trello.

   ![](https://github.com/CheesyPudding/Jasper-Test-Docs/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/customize-cards-step-7-2.png?raw=true "power-ups")
<br />
<br />

  Great job! You have now successfully created tasks for your board. If you are having trouble using lists and cards, see [Troubleshooting](https://cheesypudding.github.io/Jasper-Test-Docs/docs/index-test/).

  Have you invited your team members to your board yet? If not, [invite members to your board](https://cheesypudding.github.io/Jasper-Test-Docs/docs/customization/) to start collaborating.
