## Problem with creating a board
There are several possible reasons why you cannot create a board.


**Free tier limit**
* The free tier allows up to 10 boards to be created. However, you can close your boards to open up your limit space.

**User restrictions**
* You donâ€™t have privileges; ask admin to give you permission
* If you are the admin, team has to be created before creating a board
* Also, if you are the admin, you can first go to your Workspace Overview by clicking on the home button

Then, click on members

You can then set which member is able to send invitations or change the workplace settings.

Note: you can filter for a specific member

## Team member not receiving an invite email

* As a way of avoiding unintentional SPAM, Trello only sends one invitation email.
* Always check your SPAM first. 
* If an invitation email is not found user can manually create a Trello account at [https://trello.com/signup]: https://trello.com/signup
* If the problem persists refer to Problems with email confirmation and password reset emails section of the troubleshoot.
